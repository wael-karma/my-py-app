      <label for="name">Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br>
      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="text" id="email" name="email"><br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

In this example, the form contains two input fields for the user to enter their name and email. The form's action is set to the submit route, and the method is set to post. When the user submits the form, the data will be sent to the server and processed by the submit() function in your Flask application.

You can add more fields to the form as per your requirement, and you can also use CSS to style the form to make it more presentable.
